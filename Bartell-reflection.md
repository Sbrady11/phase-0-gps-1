* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
 - so far Git has been pretty straight forward, I think `git merge` for branches was a little confusing before adding the GitHub element

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
 - when to `git push` and how to move files was clarified in the GPS. We asked about the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull` which was good to learn because I was only using `git pull`

* What still confuses you about Git?
 - the only part I found confusing in this GPS was how to add a photo file without having to go through 2 pull requests and commits, but that's more sublime and markdown related

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
 - I really liked pairing, it was good to have a guide help and direct when we were unsure if things were going in the right direction and he helped show us some cool short cuts. Overall it was a good experience and great to learn what other questions someone else may have and just work through challenges with someone
