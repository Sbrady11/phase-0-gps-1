*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

- Prior to this, I had a tough time understanding when we were supposed to update the master. In my exercises, I'm pretty sure I would form a test branch only to immediately merge it to the master, kind of making it redundant! Not too big of a mistake in these early days, but one I'm happy to correct in such simpler times in my coding career!

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

- Commenting! Yes, my comments were all over the place before hand. At first, I was rather unsure what they were for, I believe I merely added the file name in quotes again. Then, I commented them in the past tense, such as "I did this". So now, thats much clearer. As well as when and where to merge branches.

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

- We both asked about fetching and merging, and why not just merging together the feature branch to the master. 

*What still confuses you about Git?

- This was an effective GPS I thought, so no real prevailing questions for me.

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

- To be frank, I'm excited for the next one, I think this really helped me understand what i needed to do for future Git exercises. Thanks so much to both of you for all your help and knowledge.
